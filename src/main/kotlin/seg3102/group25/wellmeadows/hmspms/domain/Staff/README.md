<h1>Staff Sub-domain</h1>

<h2>Generic</h2>
<p> The staff subdomain is the boundary around the medical staff at a hospital. </p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>
<p> It has been assigned as a generic subdomain
because the use cases mention that the actions taken by a user are based on privilege levels of each user. Thus, application 
specific functionality is not necessary and an access level based off the shelf domain can be acquired.</p>
